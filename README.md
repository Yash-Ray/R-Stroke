<code>Desktop and tablet views of page 1 done. Mobile view left.</code>


<code>There are some issues with the footer placement, just noticed that, so, i'll rectify and update it asap. Thanks</code>

<code>Update on 2-12-2020 : Both the above issues resolved and also added the next page, that is the template selection page. The footer misplacement was a lame mistake which was occusing due to an extra statement of "overflow:scroll" in the html{} part in CSS of index.css <br> Faced some difficulties in making the mobile view of the website, only in the first page till now i.e. "index.html" but i used colored borders of varying widths to identify and resolve the error. Voila!! Its Done ;)</code>
